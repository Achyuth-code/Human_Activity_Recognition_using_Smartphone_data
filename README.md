## Data 📊

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones). It contains sensor signals captured at a rate of 50 Hz from the smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope.

### Key Features 📱

- **Time domain features**: Body acceleration, gravity acceleration
- **Frequency domain features**: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of signals
- **Activity labels**: Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying

## Modeling Process 🔍

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🕵️‍♂️
   - Visualize signal distributions and analyze key statistical properties.
2. **Data Preprocessing** 🛠️
   - Handle missing values, normalize sensor data, and encode activity labels.
3. **Feature Engineering** 🔧
   - Extract meaningful features from raw signals for better model performance.
4. **Model Training** 🧠
   - Train various classifiers such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks.
5. **Evaluation Metrics** 📊
   - Assess models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results 🏆

The best-performing model achieves a high accuracy in classifying activities based on smartphone data. Key findings include:
- **Random Forest** performed exceptionally well with high accuracy and interpretability.
- **Neural Networks** provided better results for complex activity patterns.

Visualizations such as confusion matrices and feature importance plots are provided in the `results/` directory. 📉
